## Project Overview

As a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Symmons Evolution, I contributed to transforming water management through AI-driven automation and predictive analytics. This project integrated IoT sensors, machine learning models, and generative AI to create an intelligent water management platform that helps facilities conserve millions of gallons of water while reducing operational costs.

The Evolution Building Management System leverages real-time anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and LLM-powered diagnostic tools to enable proactive facility management across hospitality, commercial, and multifamily properties.

## Technical Challenge

The primary challenge was developing a scalable ML-powered anomaly detection system that could:

- Automatically detect, classify, and contextualize water inefficiencies
- Integrate seamlessly with existing Evolution platform infrastructure  
- Provide low-latency real-time processing across thousands of properties
- Generate actionable insights for non-expert facility managers through Generative AI
- Implement robust MLOps framework for continuous model improvement

## Solution Architecture

### AI-Powered Anomaly Detection

I designed and implemented machine learning models for real-time water usage analysis:

- **Time-Series ML Models**: Trained on historical sensor data (flow rates, temperature, humidity) to identify deviations from normal patterns
- **Adaptive Learning**: Self-improving models that dynamically adjust anomaly thresholds based on seasonal patterns and property characteristics
- **Multi-Sensor Correlation**: AI processing of data from multiple IoT sensors for cross-referenced anomaly validation
- **Event Classification**: Automated categorization of detected anomalies (persistent leaks, irregular consumption, equipment malfunctions)

### Scalable MLOps Infrastructure

Built a comprehensive MLOps pipeline using AWS services:

- **AWS SageMaker**: Enabled automated model training and retraining using live operational data
- **Lambda Functions**: Provided sub-second anomaly detection through serverless inference
- **API Gateway & DynamoDB**: Ensured real-time communication between AI models and facility management tools
- **Version-Controlled Deployment**: Implemented automated pipeline for validated model deployment

### Generative AI Integration

Developed LLM-powered contextualization system:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Integrated AWS Bedrock to provide specific, explainable recommendations based on technical manuals and maintenance logs
- **Automated Troubleshooting**: AI suggests corrective actions like adjusting pump flow rates or recalibrating valve settings
- **Conversational Interface**: Enabled facility managers to receive real-time troubleshooting help through AI assistants
- **Historical Analysis**: AI tracks recurring issues to identify long-term infrastructure inefficiencies

## Key Technical Contributions

### Real-Time Data Processing Pipeline

- Designed scalable data ingestion system processing millions of sensor readings

- Optimized edge computing for low-latency local anomaly detection

### Model Performance Optimization

- Developed multi-objective loss functions to balance detection accuracy with false positive rates
- Implemented dynamic threshold adjustment based on property-specific usage patterns
- Created experimentation framework for A/B testing different ML models
